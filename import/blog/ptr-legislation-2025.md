# What’s Changed in PTR Legislation in 2025?

_Published: 18 May 2025 • Author: Monochrome Compliance Team_

## Summary

The Payment Times Reporting Scheme (PTRS) underwent several important updates in 2025. These legislative refinements aim to increase clarity, strengthen compliance, and ensure that large businesses meet their obligations to pay small suppliers on time. This article outlines the key changes and what they mean for your reporting processes.

## Why the Changes Were Introduced

The PTR Regulator identified gaps in reporting consistency, classification accuracy, and enforcement strength during the first few years of the scheme’s operation. The 2025 amendments were introduced to ensure better alignment between legislative intent and practical implementation — and to improve supplier outcomes.

## Key Legislative Changes

### 1. Updated Definition of Small Business

The definition of a “small business” has been aligned with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) classification standards. This change standardises who qualifies for protection under the scheme.

> You must continue to use the Regulator’s official SBI Tool to verify small business status. Internal estimates or subjective classifications are not compliant.

### 2. Reporting Thresholds Clarified

Legislation now confirms that entities earning **exactly** $100 million in annual income are subject to PTR obligations. Previously, there was ambiguity about whether the threshold was exclusive or inclusive.

This change eliminates uncertainty and ensures consistent treatment of borderline cases.

### 3. Increased Penalties for Non-Compliance

Penalties for both late and inaccurate reporting have been significantly increased. These now include:

- Higher monetary fines
- Public visibility of infractions on the PTR register
- Potential exclusion from government procurement opportunities

> If your entity relies on government contracts, this change makes timely and accurate reporting even more critical.

### 4. Tighter Criteria for Reporting Extensions

While the biannual submission schedule remains unchanged, criteria for obtaining deadline extensions have been narrowed. Entities must now demonstrate exceptional circumstances and provide supporting documentation.

Late submissions without approval are likely to result in public censure and financial penalties.

## What This Means for Your Organisation

To meet the new expectations, reporting entities should:

- Begin data gathering and SBI validation earlier in the cycle
- Review ABN accuracy more frequently
- Assign clear internal responsibility for PTR submissions
- Use purpose-built tools like Monochrome Compliance to ensure alignment with the latest formats and rules

## Moving Forward

These changes reflect the Regulator’s intention to increase transparency and strengthen accountability. By proactively updating your processes now, you’ll avoid compliance issues later — and demonstrate your organisation’s commitment to ethical supplier practices.
