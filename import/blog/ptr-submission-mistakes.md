# Avoid These Common PTR Submission Mistakes

_Published: 18 May 2025 • Author: Monochrome Compliance Team_

## Summary

Payment Times Reporting (PTR) is more than just a regulatory checkbox — it reflects your organisation’s financial transparency and commitment to fair supplier practices. Unfortunately, many entities fall into avoidable traps during submission. In this guide, we outline the most common mistakes and how to sidestep them using sound governance and practical tools like Monochrome Compliance.

## 1. Incorrect Supplier Classification

**The mistake:** Misidentifying which suppliers qualify as small businesses, either through guesswork or outdated assumptions.

**The fix:** Always validate ABNs using the official Small Business Identification (SBI) Tool provided by the Regulator. Upload your list of ABNs and import the result into Monochrome Compliance to ensure accurate flagging. This step must be completed for each reporting cycle — past results can’t be reused.

## 2. Incomplete or Inconsistent Data

**The mistake:** Submissions that include missing invoice numbers, mismatched payment and issue dates, or incomplete payment terms.

**The fix:** Use a validation tool like Monochrome Compliance to surface issues before submission. Automate data checks and reconcile records with your finance system. Fix inconsistencies early to avoid delays during approval and reporting.

## 3. Outdated CSV Templates

**The mistake:** Using last year’s or last cycle’s CSV export template, which may be missing newly required fields or contain deprecated columns.

**The fix:** Download the latest CSV template directly from the Regulator or export through Monochrome Compliance, which always reflects the most up-to-date format. Validate your data structure before submission.

## 4. Late Submissions

**The mistake:** Leaving data collection and validation too close to the deadline, resulting in rushed reviews or missed due dates.

**The fix:** Work backwards from the deadline. Set internal submission targets at least two weeks prior, with assigned owners and checklists. Use shared calendars or integrated workflow software to monitor task completion.

## 5. No Internal Review Process

**The mistake:** Submitting reports without a second review, increasing the likelihood of human error or oversight.

**The fix:** Establish a two-person signoff process. Use Monochrome Compliance’s PDF export to generate review-ready versions. Store signed copies securely for auditing and assurance purposes.

## Bonus: Not Archiving SBI Tool Results

**The mistake:** Treating the SBI output file as temporary and failing to store it alongside your submission records.

**The fix:** Save both your original ABN input list and the SBI Tool response in a secure, access-controlled location. This serves as audit evidence and ensures continuity across reporting cycles.
