# How to Submit a PTR Report

_Published: 18 May 2025 • Author: Monochrome Compliance Team_

## Summary

Submitting a Payment Times Reporting (PTR) report is a regulatory requirement for large businesses in Australia. This guide outlines each step of the process — from data preparation and small business identification to CSV formatting and final submission — using Monochrome Compliance to simplify and streamline the workflow.

## Who Needs This?

This article is designed for individuals responsible for meeting PTR obligations, such as finance leads, governance managers, and compliance teams. If your organisation has over $100 million in annual income or is part of a group that exceeds this threshold, you are legally required to report twice yearly.

## Step-by-Step Submission Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Start by gathering supplier invoice and payment data for the current reporting period:

- Supplier ABNs
- Invoice issue and payment dates
- Payment amounts
- Contract payment terms (where available)

Ensure all transactions fall within the correct reporting window: either 1 January–30 June or 1 July–31 December. Data accuracy at this stage is critical.

### Step 2: Identify Small Business Suppliers

Export a list of all supplier ABNs and upload them to the Regulator’s Small Business Identification (SBI) Tool. The tool will return a list of ABNs that are _not_ considered small businesses. This step must be completed for each reporting cycle — you cannot rely on past results.

Once the SBI Tool output is received, upload it into Monochrome Compliance. The system will automatically flag small business transactions based on the validated ABNs.

### Step 3: Format the PTR Report

Import your cleaned and flagged dataset into Monochrome Compliance. The platform checks for:

- Missing or incorrectly formatted fields
- Inconsistencies between reported dates and payment terms
- Small business flag accuracy
- Payment practices that fall outside acceptable ranges

Any detected issues are flagged for review and correction before the final CSV output is generated.

### Step 4: Lodge the Report

Log in to the Regulator’s PTR Portal and upload the validated CSV file. You will also be prompted to complete a summary declaration and provide additional reporting information.

We strongly recommend exporting a PDF copy of your submission from the portal or taking a screenshot for internal audit purposes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I use my own template?**  
No — the Regulator mandates a specific CSV format. Monochrome Compliance automatically generates this format for you.

**What if I discover errors after submission?**  
Contact the Regulator as soon as possible. If it’s within the reporting window, you may be allowed to submit a corrected report.

**Do I need to identify small businesses manually?**  
No. You must use the SBI Tool and upload the results to your system. Manual classification is not compliant.
