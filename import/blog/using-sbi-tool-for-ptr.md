# How to Use the SBI Tool to Flag Small Business Payments

_Published: 18 May 2025 • Author: Monochrome Compliance Team_

## Summary

Correctly identifying small business suppliers is a key part of Payment Times Reporting (PTR). The Regulator provides a purpose-built Small Business Identification (SBI) Tool to ensure consistent and accurate classification of suppliers based on ABNs. This guide walks through how the tool works, why it's mandatory, and how Monochrome Compliance integrates it into your workflow.

## What Is the SBI Tool?

The SBI Tool is an online utility provided by the Payment Times Reporting Regulator. It allows entities to submit a list of supplier ABNs and returns a validated output that distinguishes which suppliers are _not_ classified as small businesses.

Under PTR legislation, this tool is the only approved method for making small business determinations. You cannot rely on internal knowledge, size estimates, or assumptions — doing so risks submitting a non-compliant report.

## Why Is This Important?

PTR obligations require entities to report how quickly they pay small businesses. If your submission fails to accurately flag these suppliers, you could understate or misrepresent your payment practices. This affects compliance outcomes and may damage your standing with regulators and the public.

Using the SBI Tool ensures:

- Consistency across reporting entities
- Confidence that your flagged data meets legal standards
- Traceable, auditable compliance history

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Prepare Your Supplier ABN List

Export a complete list of ABNs from your accounts payable records for the current reporting period. This list should:

- Be limited to suppliers who were paid during the period
- Exclude non-ABN payees (such as individuals or foreign entities without ABNs)
- Remove duplicates and validate ABN formatting (11 digits, no spaces)

### 2. Use the Regulator’s SBI Tool

- Access the tool via the PTR Regulator’s website
- Upload your CSV or paste in the ABNs according to the tool’s guidance
- Submit the request and wait for the response file

The output will contain only the ABNs that are _not_ small businesses. All others should be considered small businesses for reporting purposes.

### 3. Upload Results into Monochrome Compliance

With Monochrome Compliance, you can directly import the SBI Tool output. The platform will automatically match each ABN to your payment records and apply the appropriate small business flag.

This process eliminates manual matching and reduces the chance of error — giving you a clean, compliant PTR file.

## Additional Tips

- Run the SBI check as late as practical in the reporting cycle to ensure accuracy (e.g. ABNs may change status).
- Always double-check that your ABN data hasn’t been modified or truncated in Excel or other editors.
- Archive both your submitted ABN list and the SBI Tool output for auditing purposes.
