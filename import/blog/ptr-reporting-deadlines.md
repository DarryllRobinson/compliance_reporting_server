# PTR Reporting Deadlines: What You Need to Know

<div style="font-size: 0.875rem"><em>Published: 18 May 2025 • Author: Monochrome Compliance Team</em></div>

## Summary

The Payment Times Reporting Scheme (PTRS) operates on a fixed schedule with clearly defined reporting periods and submission deadlines. Missing a deadline not only attracts regulatory penalties but also signals to the public and your suppliers that compliance is not a priority. This article outlines what you need to know about reporting timeframes and how to stay on track.

## PTR Reporting Periods and Deadlines

Entities captured under the PTRS must submit a report **twice per year**, in line with the following periods:

- **First half-year reporting period:**  
  **1 January – 30 June**  
  **Submission due by: 30 September**

- **Second half-year reporting period:**  
  **1 July – 31 December**  
  **Submission due by: 31 March**

There are no extensions available unless formally requested and approved under exceptional circumstances. Late reports are flagged on the Regulator’s public register and may result in financial penalties.

## Why Deadlines Matter

Reporting deadlines are enforced under Australian legislation. Timeliness is an indicator of governance maturity and supplier fairness. Repeated late submissions can erode trust, damage your reputation, and impact your eligibility for government contracts.

Your submission will be visible on the public register, including whether it was submitted on time or late — making this a public-facing compliance obligation.

## Internal Planning Checklist

To stay ahead of PTR deadlines, consider embedding the following practices into your internal reporting calendar:

- **Start early:** Begin preparing data and reviewing supplier lists 6–8 weeks before the due date
- **Nominate a lead:** Assign a dedicated owner for PTR reporting, usually within Finance or Governance
- **Set internal checkpoints:** Schedule key milestones for SBI Tool checks, data validation, and internal review
- **Conduct a dry run:** Generate a draft report and review it with relevant stakeholders before finalisation
- **Use shared calendars:** Set recurring internal reminders well ahead of the official submission dates

## Risks of Missing the Deadline

If your organisation fails to meet its PTR obligation on time:

- Your entity will be listed as non-compliant on the PTR public register
- Financial penalties may apply
- You may be subject to increased scrutiny from procurement bodies and regulators
- Future reporting may be monitored more closely
