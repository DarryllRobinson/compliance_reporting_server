When it comes to Payment Times Reporting, clean data is everything.

Before you upload your CSV file or generate your final report, take a few minutes to check for common issues that can cause delays — or worse, non-compliance.

## 1. Confirm Required Fields Are Present

Make sure your data includes:

- ABNs for both payer and payee
- Invoice date and payment date
- Payment amount
- Contract or PO reference (if applicable)

Don’t leave mandatory fields blank — the validator will flag them immediately.

## 2. Watch for Typos and Formatting Errors

- Use consistent date formats (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD)
- Round payment values to whole dollars if needed
- Avoid invisible characters or extra whitespace

A simple find-and-replace or export to plain CSV can help clear these up.

## 3. Use Our Template

The best way to avoid errors? Use the [CSV template](/resources) we’ve provided. It includes the right column headers, in the right order — and some bonus tips in the comments too.

## 4. Preview Your Report Before Submitting

Our platform offers a live preview of your summary stats, validation errors, and flagged records. Use it. Fix it. Then finalise.
