# Who Needs to Report Under the Payment Times Reporting Scheme?

_Published: 18 May 2025 • Author: Monochrome Compliance Team_

## Summary

If your business operates in Australia and earns over $100 million in annual income, you may be required to report under the Payment Times Reporting Scheme (PTRS). This article explains who is considered a reporting entity and what criteria determine eligibility.

## What Is a Reporting Entity?

A reporting entity under PTRS is broadly defined as:

- An individual business with total annual income over $100 million, or
- A controlling corporation (parent company) whose combined subsidiaries exceed the $100 million threshold

Eligibility is based on the most recent income year prior to the reporting period.

## Thresholds and Triggers

### 1. Income Threshold

Businesses with over $100 million in total income (not just turnover) are required to report. This includes:

- Australian entities
- Foreign entities with Australian operations
- Corporate groups under a controlling corporation

### 2. Corporate Groups

If your entity is part of a group controlled by a parent entity that exceeds $100 million in consolidated income, the entire group may be captured under the scheme. Only the controlling corporation submits the PTR report for all group members.

### 3. Other Trigger Events

Entities may also become subject to PTR reporting if they acquire another entity or experience substantial structural changes affecting income.

## Examples

- A standalone company with $120M annual income → Must report
- A holding company with $40M income but subsidiaries that earn $150M → Must report as a controlling corporation
- A foreign company with a branch operating in Australia earning $110M → Must report
